Natural language processing in Machine Learning.


#   Types of machine learning 
    1. supervised machine learning
    2. unsupervised machine learning

        # Type of Supervised machine learning

        1. classification 
        2. Regression

        Example : features 
                    input features = f1, f2, f3 f4 ( independent features )
                    output features = this is known as dependent feature.


RoadMap of NLP ->
Machine learning techniques:
    1. programing language ( python)
    2. text preprocessing.
        Step1 :
        cleaning the user input.
            a. tokenization 
            b. lemmatization
            c. stemming
            d. stop words
        Step2:
            focus converting text data into vectors 
            1. bag of words (BOW)
            2. TF-IDF 
            3. Unigrams
            4. Bigrams
        Step3 :
            Advance techniques to text preprocessing
            1. word2vec 
            2. Avgword2vec


Deep leaning techniques
These are some neurals networks 
    1. RNN
    2. LSTM
    3. GRU
    4. RNN
2. word embedding :
    this techniques alos used to convert text into vectors
3. Transformers
4. BERT
